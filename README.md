# STEM Computer Vision
## Mobile apps for iOS and Android

I built this simple Xamarin.Forms solution for a local school's STEM event that I was attending as a STEM Ambassador. I found that using and stepping through the apps provided a fun and interactive learning experience for the students. 

### What does it do?
It allows users to take a photo or select an image from the device and uses Micrsoft's facial recognition api to detect one or more human faces in the image and return back face rectangles for where in the image the faces are, along with face attributes that contain machine learning-based predictions of facial features.

### To use it
Please feel free to follow these steps to use the apps for your own STEM events. 

* Download and open the solution on either Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac
* Update the FaceApiKey property in App.xaml.cs with a key you can get for free from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/face
* Run!
